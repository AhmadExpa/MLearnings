    "# Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns to predict output based on labeled input data. The algorithm works under the supervision of a teacher who teaches it to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions based on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is used when the output is categorical, i.e., it falls under a specific category. The algorithm learns to classify the data into specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is used when the output is numerical, i.e., it falls under a specific range of values. The algorithm learns to predict the outcome based on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various supervised learning algorithms. Some of the popular algorithms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression/ Multi-linear Regression / Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is used when there is only one input variable, whereas multi-linear regression is used when there are more than one input variables. Logistic regression is used for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are used for both regression and classification problems. They learn a hierarchy of if/else questions and make predictions based on the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-NN (K Nearest Neighbour)\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN is a classification algorithm that works by identifying the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point and predicting the class of that data point based on the majority class of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel SVM is a classification algorithm that maps data into a high-dimensional feature space and then finds a separating hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SVM (Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. It is simple and fast and works well with high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-NN\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN is a classification algorithm that works by identifying the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point and predicting the class of that data point based on the majority class of its neighbors. It can also be used for numerical data regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-NN Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of K-NN can be measured using various metrics such as Jaccard index, F1 score, log loss, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of a classification model can be measured using metrics such as area under curve, confusion matrix, mean squared error, and mean absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons of K-NN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training phase is faster \n",
    "- Instance-based learning algorithm\n",
    "- Can be used with non-linear data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing phase is slower\n",
    "- Costly for power\n",
    "- Not suitable for large dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Improve K-NN?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN can be improved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data wrangling and scaling\n",
    "- Dealing with missing values (noise)\n",
    "- Normalizing on the same scale for every reduce dimension to improve dimensionality reduction.\n",
